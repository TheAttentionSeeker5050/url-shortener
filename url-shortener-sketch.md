# url-shortener sketch

## Expected features

- This application will be a simple url shortener. You add an url and it will give another randomized shorter url.
- I better get a short domain.
- Prepare for upload to heroku
- When someone clicks on the shorter url, it returns them to the bigger url.
- For the moment that is what it will have.
- Shortened urls will be visible to anyone but only the owner will be able to modify it.

- Ejs/CSS/Bootstrap
- Nodejs/express
